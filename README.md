## Introduction
- In this assignment we need to build a model forWhat factors are important for determining the cost of a house.

## Problem Statement
- Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate firm, has chosen to enter the Australian market. In order to buy homes for less than their actual value and sell them for more, the company uses data analytics. A data set from Australian home sales has been gathered by the company for the same objective. The business is looking at potential properties to purchase in order to enter the market. In order to determine the potential properties' actual value and whether to invest in them, you must construct a regression model using regularisation.

-The company is curious about:
1)Which elements are crucial for estimating the cost of a property, and
2)How accurately such factors reflect a home's pricing.

## Business Goal
- Modeling the cost of homes using the relevant independent variables is required. The management will then utilise this model to determine exactly how the prices fluctuate depending on the variables. As a result, they can influence the company's strategy and concentrate on areas that will provide large returns. The tool will also help management better understand how prices change in a new market..
